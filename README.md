# This is the repository for the test

## Problem 1:
I have used 3 ways: recursive, loop and basic math formula

## Problem 2:
I'm using Vite for this one, taking too much time to make it beautiful and clean, then I forgot to add test case for this. But I can definitely writing test file with both Jest/Enzyme and react-test-renderer


## Problem 3:
I have 2 files. One with the original code and the explaination at the end of the file. One with the refactor code
